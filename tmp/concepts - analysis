# Problem
##################
between 800am to 1115

What we can do? --> remove those terminal like "to, from, at" from "Word"

Problem with the word "to, on"
- on the flight from ...
- Word -> to Word: 400/1000
- Word -> on Word: 438/1000
- MonthNameConcept & DayNumberConcept: 464/1000
- DayRelativeConcept: 465/1000
- 315. i need to go from boston to atlanta and back in the same day find me the earliest flight from boston --> problem with "and"
- Word -> and Word: 480 / 1000
- Modify Phrase --> abc Phrase and add Phrase --> NP Phrase: 409/1000
- Remove NP, 480/1000
- Word -> <epsilon> and PP -> on Word DateName to recognize "on this coming thursday" 510/1000
- PP by way of StopConcept --> 469/1000
- Add Word -> by Word, Word -> way Word, Word -> of Word --> 513/1000
+ 'after' is mapped to 'time_relative': 513/1000
+ the problem lies in w2class, since 'after' is mapped at that point.
So I tried to add every freq_words as abc -> abc, however the result is suprisingly low, around 3xx/1000 --> 500/1000
+ add before, before; after, after in manually_annotated_class --> 508/1000
+ get all words with len < 7 to be in freq_word --> 537/1000
+ PP -> to ToConcept and ToConcept --> 518
- PP leave FromConcept --> 522/1000
+ PP -> from Word --> 620/1000
+ PP -> to Word --> 620/1000
+ PP -> on DayNameConcept DateNameon 627/1000
+ PP -> leaving DayNameConcept depart_date.period_of_day & Word -> leaving -> 627/1000
+ OtherConcept -> roundtrip 680/1000
+ FlightNumber -> flight flight_number & Word -> flight -> 680/1000
+ PP -> for DateName -> 656/1000
+ Word -> for --> 683 / 1000
+ FlightWord -> flight | flights 719 / 1000
+ PP -> between FromConcept and ToConcept -> 767/1000
+ FLightNumber -> in a flight_number & Word -> in | a --> 779/1000
+ PP -> on the DayNumberConcept -> 782 / 1000
+ DateName -> DayNameConcept --> 796 / 1000
